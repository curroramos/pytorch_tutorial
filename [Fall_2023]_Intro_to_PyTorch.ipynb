It is not as flexible as `nn.Module`, because you cannot specify more complex topology than a feed-forward stack, but it's good enough for many use cases. This should feel familiar to the section on torch transforms since the `transforms.Compose` transform for containing multiple transforms at once sort of works in a similar way.\n",
